# Smooth Anchor Scrolling

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/uixmat/pen/exByn](https://codepen.io/uixmat/pen/exByn).

Super lightweight smooth anchor scrolling. You are able to switch navigation 'active' class and scroll smoothly to id's throughout the page. I have also tweaked the code to allow for linking to id's from outside the main navigation. I have also included a basic scrollTop function.
